Hi! I'm Evan. I'm an engineer currently interested in infrastructure, cloud, and DevOps. I'm used to Terraform and Ansible. I also have experience with Kubernetes and Docker, which picks my interest the most now. I usually wander around the cloud technology provided by Google and Amazon. Most of my time now is spent as a Kubernetes cluster administrator. In my free time I usually learn Go or Python, or hop into my PC to watch anime or play some games.
