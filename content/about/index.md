I'm Evan. I'm an engineer currently interested in infrastructure, cloud, and DevOps. 

I'm used to Terraform and Ansible. I also have experience with Kubernetes and Docker, which picks my interest the most now. I usually wander around the cloud technology provided by Google and Amazon. 

I write YAML files for a living. In my free time I'm learning programming in Go or Python. If I get bored I usually hop into my PS4 to play some games or watch anime.
