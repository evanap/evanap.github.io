Well, for quite some time I've been looking to put this personal site of my own. Been stuck in choosing which platform will host this site, whether it's building the platform myself maybe using Docker or some single node Kubernetes cluster, or just a simple web server hosted by a single instance on some cloud. But, the choice comes down to GitHub Pages. It's easy and hassle-free. So, yeah, there's that. 

Anyway, welcome.
